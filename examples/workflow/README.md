# Qstash Workflow Examples

This project has some routes showcasing how Qstash Workflow can be used in a nextjs project.

Under the app directory, you will find 5 folders, each corresponding to a workflow API.

In each of these folders, you will find the `route.ts` file which defines the workflow and a `trigger.sh` script to trigger the endpoint.
